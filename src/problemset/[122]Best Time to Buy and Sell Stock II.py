# You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given 
# stock on the iᵗʰ day. 
# 
#  On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold 
# at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then 
# immediately sell it on the same day. 
# 
#  Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 
# 5-1 = 4.
# Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
# 
# Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 
# 5-1 = 4.
# Total profit is 4.
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the 
# stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10⁴ 
#  0 <= prices[i] <= 10⁴
