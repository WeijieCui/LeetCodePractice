# Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if 
# they are the same or not. 
# 
#  Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, 
# and the nodes have the same value. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
# Output: true
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
# Output: false
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
#  
#  
# Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
# Output: false
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100]. 
#  -10‚Å¥ <= Node.val <= 10‚Å¥
